## 📌 Overview

BlogChain is a decentralized application (dApp) that puts publishing
directly on-chain. Posts and comments are stored as Soroban smart contract
state on the **Stellar** network — there's no central server, no
content-moderation layer, and no privileged admin key. Once deployed, the
contract governs itself; the Next.js frontend is just a client for it.

Every write (publishing a post, adding a comment) is a transaction the
**Freighter** wallet extension simulates and signs in the browser before
it's submitted to Soroban. There is no backend API and no database — the
entire application state lives on the Stellar ledger.

## 🚀 Features

### Currently implemented

- **Permissionless publishing** — any Stellar address can publish a post
  directly to the contract; no allowlist, no approval step, no admin gate.
- **On-chain storage** — post title, content, author, timestamp, and
  comment count live in Soroban contract state, not a database.
- **Comments** — anyone can comment on any post, signed by their own
  Freighter wallet and stored on-chain against that post.
- **Freighter wallet integration** — connect, request access, and sign
  every write transaction from the browser; the app never touches a
  private key.
- **Simulate-before-submit** — every write is simulated via the Soroban RPC
  before the wallet is asked to sign, so failures surface before a
  transaction is broadcast.
- **Feed / Write / View tabs** — browse all published posts, publish a new
  one, or open a single post to read its full content and comment thread.
- **Error monitoring & analytics, opt-in** — Sentry and PostHog are wired
  in and simply no-op if you don't configure them (see `client/.env.example`).

### Not yet implemented

A few ideas that are natural next steps for this architecture — likes,
tipping, tags, and a trending sort — are **not** in the current contract or
UI. They're tracked honestly in [Roadmap](#-roadmap--future-improvements)
rather than claimed here.

## 🏗️ Architecture

There is no backend. The browser talks to the wallet extension and to the
public Soroban RPC directly; the smart contract is the only source of
truth.

        UI["Next.js App<br/>(React client components)"]
        FW["Freighter<br/>(browser extension)"]
    end

    RPC["Soroban RPC<br/>soroban-testnet.stellar.org"]
    SC["Soroban Smart Contract<br/>(Rust / Wasm)"]
    Ledger[("Stellar Ledger<br/>on-chain state")]

    UI -- "1. build + simulate tx" --> RPC
    UI -- "2. request signature" --> FW
    FW -- "3. signed tx" --> UI
    UI -- "4. submit signed tx" --> RPC
    RPC -- "invoke" --> SC
    SC -- "read/write state" --> Ledger
    RPC -- "5. read posts/comments" --> UI
```

**Read path:** the UI calls the contract's read-only functions
(`get_all_posts`, `get_post`, `get_comments`) through the RPC's simulation
endpoint — no signature or fee required.

**Write path:** the UI builds a transaction invoking `create_post` or
`add_comment`, simulates it, sends it to Freighter for a signature, then
submits the signed XDR back to the RPC for inclusion in the ledger.

## 📜 Smart Contract Overview

The contract (`contract/contracts/contract/src/lib.rs`) is intentionally
small and has **no owner, no pause switch, and no upgrade proxy** — once
deployed, its logic is immutable and every function is callable by any
address.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_post(author, title, content) -> u64` | Stores a new post, auto-increments the post ID, returns it. |
| `get_post(post_id) -> Post` | Reads a single post by ID. |
| `add_comment(post_id, author, content) -> u64` | Appends a comment to a post and increments that post's `comment_count`. |
| `get_comments(post_id) -> Vec<Comment>` | Reads all comments for a post. |
| `get_all_posts() -> Vec<Post>` | Reads every published post. |

**Storage layout** (all in Soroban *instance* storage):

- `DataKey::PostCounter` → `u64`, the last-issued post ID
- `DataKey::Posts` → `Map<u64, Post>`, every post keyed by ID
- `DataKey::Comments(post_id)` → `Vec<Comment>`, per-post comment list

**`Post`**: `id`, `title`, `content`, `author`, `comment_count`, `timestamp`
**`Comment`**: `id`, `content`, `author`, `timestamp`

Build with the Stellar CLI (not plain `cargo build` — see `INSTALL.md` for
why): `stellar contract build`. The release profile in `contract/Cargo.toml`
(`opt-level = "z"`, `lto = true`, `strip = "symbols"`) keeps the compiled
Wasm under Soroban's 64KB contract size limit.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Requirements

Node.js ≥ 20.9, npm, the [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app) browser
extension, and — only if you're touching the contract — Rust ≥ 1.84 with
the `wasm32v1-none` target and the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli/install-cli).
Full details: [`REQUIREMENTS.md`](./REQUIREMENTS.md).

### Installation

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd decentralized-blog-main/client
npm install
```

### Running locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), install Freighter if
you haven't, switch its network to **Testnet**, and connect your wallet.

### Building for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Full step-by-step instructions — including running the contract's test
suite and redeploying it yourself — are in [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md).

## 🚢 Deployment

The frontend is a standard Next.js app and deploys anywhere Next.js does
(e.g. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)). The smart contract is deployed
independently via the Stellar CLI:

```bash
cd contract/contracts/contract
stellar contract build
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/contract.wasm \
  --source <your-identity> \
  --network testnet
```

Then point `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `client/hooks/contract.ts` at the ID that
command prints. See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md#8-deploying--redeploying-the-contract)
for the full walkthrough, including funding a testnet account via
Friendbot.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No content moderation — once published, a post cannot be removed.
- The contract is immutable — there is no upgrade mechanism.
- Fully on-chain storage means cost grows with the number of posts/comments.
- No indexing layer — the frontend reads the full post list from the
  contract directly; this won't scale indefinitely (see Roadmap).

## 🔮 Roadmap / Future Improvements

- **Likes** — toggle-like a post, stored per address to prevent
  double-counting.
- **Direct XLM tipping** — tip an author directly, with no platform cut and
  no escrow.
- **Tags** — categorize posts (DeFi, DAOs, Soroban, etc.) for discovery.
- **Trending feed** — rank posts by engagement instead of only recency.
- **"My Posts" filter** — filter the feed to the connected wallet's own
  posts.
- **Indexing** — an off-chain index (or a subquery-style indexer) for
  faster querying as the number of posts grows, without giving up
  the on-chain source of truth.
- **Explorer deep-links** — link each post directly to its transaction on
  Stellar Expert.
